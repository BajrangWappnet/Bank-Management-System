# Bank-Management-System
## The Problem
### A bank's operations include the customer experience as a key component. Banks put a lot of effort into optimising the client experience by removing obstacles and upgrading the services they offer. In order to open a new account at a bank, a person often needs to go there, complete the relevant paperwork, and fill out a form. These activities all take a lot of time and detract from the general client experience. In addition, many consumers must take time away from their busy schedules to visit a bank.
## The Solution
### This issue can be resolved by developing software that enables users to register for and open new bank accounts online. The individual would save a great deal of time and effort by avoiding the need to physically visit the bank in this manner. The user can perform transactions, make deposits and withdrawals, and view account balances using the banking management system.
